            ## Id
            AWSResilienceHub-RebootDocumentDBInstanceTest_2020-09-21

            ## Intent
            Test DocumentDB cluster availability after rebooting the instance and application can reconnect
            after temporary network errors within expected recovery time

            ## Type
            TEST

            ## Risk
            Small

            ## Requirements
              * Available DocumentDB Cluster
              * There is a [synthetic alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries.html) setup for application that alerts when application can't connect

            ## Permissions required for AutomationAssumeRole
              * cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms
              * rds:RebootDBInstance
              * rds:DescribeDBInstances

            ##### In case cluster is encrypted with a KMS key
              * kms:DescribeKey

            ## Supports Rollback
            No

            ## Cancellation behavior
            Fails

            ## Inputs
            ### (Required) AutomationAssumeRole
              * type: String
              * description: ARN of the IAM role with permissions listed above

            ### (Required) DBClusterIdentifier
              * type: String
              * description: DocumentDB Cluster Identifier

            ### (Required) DatabaseConnectionAttemptAlarmName
              * type: String
              * description: Name of the alarm that indicates that the application can't connect to DocumentDB

            ### (Optional) IsRollback
              * type: String
              * description: Run the rollback steps of the document. True or False. If True, the parameter PreviousExecutionId should also be specified
              * default: false

            ### (Optional) PreviousExecutionId
              * type: String
              * description: SSM execution ID of the previous execution of this document for which resources need to be cleaned up

            ## Details
            The document reboots DocumentDB instance and wait for it to become available. Synthetic alarm should show
            that application can connect to the DocumentDB instance.

            ## Steps executed in normal flow
              * AssertAlarmToBeGreenBeforeTest
              * RebootDbInstance
              * WaitUntilInstancesAvailable
              * AssertAlarmToBeGreen

            ## Outputs
            None
